### Used Architecture

VIPER Architecture

### Dependency Graph

The dependence graph is unidirectional, which means:  <br />
**View** knows about **Presenter**.  <br />
**Presenter** knows about **Router** ,**Interactor** and **View**.  <br />
**Interactor** grab data from **Workers _ Utilities**.  <br />
**Workers** communicates with repositories.

Every inner layer doesn't know anything about the outer layer. <br />
**delegates (protocols)** used to establish a pipline from inner layers to outer layers, to inform outer layers about the changes in inner layers.

### Third Party Libraries

**Alamofire** for network requests. <br />
**kingFisher** for downloading images.

### Services

Flicker API
